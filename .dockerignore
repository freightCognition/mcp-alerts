# IMPORTANT: Your project contains both package-lock.json and pnpm-lock.yaml.
# Choose ONE as your primary lock file for reproducible builds.
# The CHOSEN lock file should NOT be listed here in .dockerignore,
# and it should ideally be REMOVED from .gitignore and committed to your repository.
# The OTHER lock file (not used for deployment) should be listed below.
# Example: If package-lock.json is your primary, add pnpm-lock.yaml here.
# If pnpm-lock.yaml is your primary, add package-lock.json here.
